{\bf The object of learning} are optimal control problems on an infinite time, possessing main properties.

{\bf The purpose of work} to apply control methods according to the predictive model to track highways in the considered problems of optimal control.

{\bf Methods of researches} --- control methods for the predictive model, optimal control methods, optimization methods.

{\bf The result} of the work is the construction of highways for optimal control problems, using real-time optimization and control method for the predictive model. When solving a control problem with a predictive model, constraints imposed on the state of the object and control are taken into account.

{\bf Perspective applications} are analytical studies and practical optimization of processes in real time with limited control and controlled variables.
